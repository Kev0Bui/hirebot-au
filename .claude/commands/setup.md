# /setup — Onboarding Interview

You are running the onboarding setup for Hirebot AU. Your job is to interview the user conversationally and populate their profile files with accurate, detailed information.

## Process

### Step 1 — Welcome

Say something like:

> Welcome to Hirebot AU! I'm going to ask you some questions to build your professional profile. This usually takes 10–15 minutes.
>
> Your answers will be saved to the `profile/` files in this repo. I'll confirm everything before writing anything.
>
> You can also paste in an existing CV or LinkedIn summary if you'd like me to extract details from it — just let me know.

### Step 2 — Conversational Interview

Ask questions **one section at a time**, not all at once. Wait for the user to respond before moving on. Use a natural, conversational tone.

**Section A — The Basics**
- What's your full name?
- What are you doing right now — are you working, studying, or between roles?
- What kind of roles are you looking for? (titles, industries)
- Where are you based, and are you open to remote, hybrid, or office-based work?
- Do you have a salary range in mind? (If they're unsure, offer Australian market context for their target roles.)

**Section B — Work Experience**
- Walk me through your last 3–5 roles. For each one:
  - Job title, company, and dates
  - What did you actually do? (Not just the title — the projects, tools, and outcomes)
  - What are you most proud of from that role?
- OR: "Would you like to paste your CV text and I'll extract the details?"

**Section C — Skills and Education**
- What tools and technologies do you use regularly?
- What soft skills do colleagues praise you for?
- What's your educational background?
- Any certifications or professional development worth mentioning?

**Section D — Behavioural Examples**
- Ask for STAR examples across the six themes in `02-behavioural.md`:
  1. Leadership
  2. Conflict resolution
  3. Dealing with ambiguity
  4. Delivering under pressure
  5. Cross-functional collaboration
  6. Failure and learning
- It's fine if they can only fill 3–4 to start. Note which ones are missing for later.

**Section E — Writing Style**
- How would you describe your professional writing tone? (e.g. direct, warm, conversational, formal)
- What should I always do in your cover letters?
- What should I never do?
- Any phrases that sound like you? Any that definitely don't?
- Do you prefer first person or third person in your CV?

**Section F — Interview Prep**
- Are there any common interview questions you'd like to prepare for?
- What questions do you usually ask interviewers?
- Any salary negotiation notes you want to capture?

### Step 3 — Confirm Before Writing

Before writing anything, present a summary of what you're about to save:

> Here's what I've captured. I'll save this across your profile files. Please review and let me know if anything needs changing:
>
> **01-candidate.md:** [summary]
> **02-behavioural.md:** [summary]
> **03-writing-style.md:** [summary]
> **04-interview-prep.md:** [summary]
> **config.yaml updates:** [summary of target roles, locations, salary range]

Wait for confirmation.

### Step 4 — Write Files

Once confirmed:
1. Update `profile/01-candidate.md` with all professional details
2. Update `profile/02-behavioural.md` with STAR examples (leave guidance text for any unfilled slots)
3. Update `profile/03-writing-style.md` with tone and language preferences
4. Update `profile/04-interview-prep.md` with any interview prep notes
5. Update `config.yaml` with confirmed `candidate_name`, `target_roles`, `locations`, `salary_min_aud`, `salary_max_aud`, and `work_types`

### Step 5 — Summary and Next Steps

End with:

> Setup complete! Here's what was saved:
>
> - ✅ Professional profile (profile/01-candidate.md)
> - ✅ Behavioural examples (profile/02-behavioural.md)
> - ✅ Writing style guide (profile/03-writing-style.md)
> - ✅ Interview prep notes (profile/04-interview-prep.md)
> - ✅ Configuration updated (config.yaml)
>
> **Next steps:**
> - Run `/scrape` to search for jobs matching your profile
> - Run `/apply` with a job URL to generate a tailored CV and cover letter
> - You can re-run `/setup` any time to update your profile

## Rules

- Never fabricate or embellish details. Only write what the user tells you.
- If the user is vague, ask follow-up questions to get specifics.
- Use Australian English spelling throughout.
- Keep the conversational tone — this shouldn't feel like a form.
- If the user pastes a CV, extract details accurately and confirm your interpretation before writing.
